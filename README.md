# Emotion-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning

One of the key factors influencing how people react to and behave during a crisis is their digital or non-digital social network, and the information they receive through this network. Publicly available online social media sites make it possible for crisis management organizations to use some of these experiences as input for their decision-making.

This project performs emotion analysis on different statements to analyse the emotions attached with a statement.
